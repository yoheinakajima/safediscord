Bot to text me if someone other than me posts in announcements channel on Discord

# Notes:
To get this to work, you'll need:
- Set up .env w your Discord token
- Update the channel ID to your announcement channel
- Update verified users who you expect to post in that channel
- Set up Zapier to text you when this triggers

I'm not really a dev, so apologies for poor documentation, but this should work!
